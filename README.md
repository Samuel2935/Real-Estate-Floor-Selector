# Real-Estate-Floor-Selector
This is a real estate floor selector app  that allows potential buyers or renters to view and select specific units or floors within a real estate property, such as an apartment building, condo complex, or commercial tower.

# Key Features
1. <h5>Interactive Floor Plan</h5>
<p>Users can click on different floors.</p>
<p>Each floor can be explored.</p>
2. <h5>Unit Details on Click</h5>
When a user clicks a specific unit, they see details like:
<p>Price</p>
<p>Size (sq ft/m²)</p>
<p>Number of rooms</p>




– A tower overview page showing three towers (e.g., Tower A, B, C) as clickable cards or sections

– When a tower is selected: a floor view with a list of 10–15 floors

– When a floor is selected: show 3–4 apartment layouts with

 • Thumbnail image (placeholder is fine)

 • Metadata: area, unit type, room count (dummy data is fine)

– When a layout is selected: show a larger layout image and full metadata


Bonus interaction:

When hovering over a unit thumbnail, the floor background behind it should subtly darken and the thumbnail should scale up slightly with a soft animation. This should work smoothly on both desktop and mobile.
